                      <p className="p-13">YOU AND ALFINDER AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION, ENFORCEMENT, INTERPRETATION OR VALIDITY THEREOF, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION OF THE SCOPE OR APPLICABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, SHALL BE DETERMINED BY ARBITRATION BEFORE ONE ARBITRATOR. THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE ADMINISTERED BY JAMS PURSUANT TO ITS COMPREHENSIVE ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXPEDITED PROCEDURES IN THOSE RULES. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not prevent parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.</p>
                      <p className="p-13">However, we agree that if your claim is small enough that the law allows you to file it in a small claims court, you may do so instead of submitting to binding arbitration. We will submit to binding arbitration in any event.</p>

                      <p className="p-13">If a court refuses to enforce the waiver of class-wide arbitration, this entire arbitration provision shall be unenforceable and any claims brought on behalf of a putative class will proceed in court.</p>
                      <p className="p-13">IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.</p>
                      <p className="p-13">The parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and any award, including the arbitration hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</p>
                      <p className="p-13">The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by JAMS or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of these Terms of Service and will be final and binding.</p>
                      <p className="p-13">In any arbitration arising out of or related to this agreement, there shall be no interrogatories or requests to admit.</p>
                      <p className="p-13">IN ANY ARBITRATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE ARBITRATOR(S) ARE NOT EMPOWERED TO AWARD PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, EXCEPT WHERE PERMITTED BY STATUTE, AND THE PARTIES WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RECOVER ANY SUCH DAMAGES. THE ARBITRATOR(S) MAY NOT AWARD ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS.</p>
                      <p className="p-13">As stated in Section 18 of these Terms of Service, Arizona law governs this entire agreement, but the parties acknowledge that this agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce, and that notwithstanding Section 18, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
